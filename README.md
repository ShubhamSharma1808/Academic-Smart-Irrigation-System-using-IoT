- Goal of making the project
    - To automate the watering of the plants in a private garden or a lawn.
    - It uses soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, light dependent resistor and accordingly shows whether plants get proper
      light or not , its moisture is appropriate to what it should be, is the temp. too high for the plant.
    - from these inputs it controls the pump. when the moisture is too less it starts the pump and runs for a particular amount of time.
    - Now this information is send to the mobile devices using bluetooth module which is connected to the arduino board. all the current readings 
      are directly send to the device in the range. and from the device we can also manually control the pump by switching it on/off.
